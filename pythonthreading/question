a program that simulates ATM withdrawals while allowing balance checks simultaneously.

Scenario:
Multiple users can withdraw money from the same bank account.

While some users are withdrawing, others can check the balance in real-time.

This ensures that the balance updates correctly and doesn't allow over-withdrawals.
